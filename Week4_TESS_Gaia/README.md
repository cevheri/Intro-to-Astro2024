* [A Community Builder's Toolkit](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/u9t4c2u97mtlksysxp414/AAEyzFf6Lk1J7_aVxjH68kk/01%20Facilitation?dl=0&preview=A+Community+Builder%27s+Toolkit.pdf&rlkey=hptcst7fegkmye7qvziqe3m4u&subfolder_nav_tracking=1)
#### The "Tools for Creating Healthy, Productive Interracial/Multicultural Communities"
 The "Tools for Creating Healthy, Productive Interracial/Multicultural Communities" handbook outlines various strategies and principles essential for fostering inclusive communities. It begins with an introduction explaining the handbook's origins and the importance of understanding race and undoing racism, creating a sense of community, and realizing the promise of democracy. The toolkit is designed for those seeking to build equitable and inclusive environments and is especially pertinent in the current climate.

Key tools include making plans with community members rather than for them, setting broad goals, developing effective strategies, and choosing the right leadership. It emphasizes the need for equitable governance and prioritizes addressing racism. The handbook encourages drawing strength from multicultural identities, bridging language barriers, securing funding, and aligning analysis with action. Remaining connected to the community, forming and maintaining constructive partnerships, leveraging media, continuous self-assessment, and a long-term commitment are also crucial components.
